# MutantGenerator

Winforms program (runs on Windows) that randomly generates characters for a role-playing game. When program runs it rolls a human character and displays it to the GUI. User has the option to roll a new human character, mutate the existing character, save the character, load a saved character, or print a screen capture of the GUI.

## Functionality

- running the program randomly generates a human
- roll a new random character by hitting the Roll Human button
- or mutate the existing human character by hitting the Mutate button (can't mutate same human more than once)
- save either human or mutant by hitting the Save button (saves XML file to local computer)
- load up a saved character by hitting the Load button
- print GUI by hitting the Print button (looks a little ugly at this stage, but seems to work)

## Game system

Game system is a custom set of rules I'm working on based on d10 dice (rules not provided). The same logic can be applied to other RPG systems.
